# Carousel

Dear Sir/Madam,
Please find here the instructions how to make your own carousel by using CSS and Javascript:
1. Create an index.html file where will be made carousel container with full-width images, which are located in this project in IMAGES folder, caption text, previous and next buttons, slideshow indicators to choose needed slide. 
2. Create links in index.html file to CSS and JS files. 
3. Create CSS (style.css) file where will be styled all elements by using mostly classes.
4. Create JS (script.js) file where will be made functions which will switch automatically or manually slides and make them go around (after the last slide to switch to the first slide) by using classes(.mySlides, .dot), conditional statements (if), loops (for) and method (setTimeout).

Carousel slideshow ir working automatically, but images can be switched manually by pressing arrows on the left or on the right on the image or by pressing any dots (indicators) under the slideshow.
